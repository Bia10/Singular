change- Training Dummies: for those prefering to fight things that don't fight back, Singular now automatically switches to Instance spell priorities if targeting a Training Dummy.  Too many people reporting results while using Singular and not in a group (so Solo/Questing spell priority used which is maximized for quick kills and survival, not Raid Boss DPS.)

change- Singular will now output a message when ANY component changes the Pull Distance unless you are in a Raid. Previously this was done only while questing and with debug mode turned on. Since a number of issues have been reported due to running with a Pull Distance of 0 or 1, this will make sure the user is aware of the low value that will prevent the botbase from invoking the Combat Routine for Pulling mobs.

Shaman

fixed - Restoration - was previously setup for long range Pull behavior ( 35 - 40 yds ) which is out of range of spells.  Corrected to medium range Pull ( 25 - 30 yds ).  The reference to Pull here is regarding internal logic and has no relation to the Pull Distance setting in HonorBuddy

Quest Profiles will be undergoing a transition in the near future where they will be disabling the Combat Routine for different vehicle quests. Until that work is completed, the Combat Routine has to disable itself.  This setting will allow Singular to work correctly in both situations.  To understand whether this should be 'true' or 'false' for your usage, check with your Quest Profile Author.

*new* - All Specs - pre- and post- pick pocket wait time setting to provide customization for users encountering latency issues relative to the use of pick pocket. the pre-pick pocket delay helps with ensuring the Rogue is a full stop.

*new* - Solo Pet Tanking.  While solo, classes with a Pet will send that pet to agro targets attacking the player, as long as the pets current target is not the player.  This will increase survivability in multi-mob fights especially at lower levels.  A setting in Class Config named Solo Pet Tanking can be set to false if you prefer the Pet remain on your current target.  This applies to solo (questing/grinding) only.  In PVP and Instances, the Pet will always attack players current target.

fixed - problem with list of Bosses not initiliazing

change- Singular no longer prevents Combat or other behaviors when on transports.  This was interfering with some DungeonBuddy scripts.  The primary place this would be needed is during questing and that should now be handled by Quest Behaviors if needed

change- Heal settings are output to long once per context change.  previously output for each behavior which referenced them creating setting spam in log in some cases.  Currently only noticeable with Shaman and Holy Priests

change- Auto Attack started only for Melee classes/specs.  This has been requested numerous times, so if you encounter any issues be certain to attach a complete debug log with your post

fixed - Targeting. Singular does not target often, but will validate the current target and switch if the Bot indicates it should.  Some minor refinements as well as a bug fix for some cases where Questing bot had a BotPOI that was different than the Targeting.FirstUnit it prioritized

fixed - workaround for some issues where HonorBuddy SpellManager.canCast() was indicating false for certain spells.

fixed - Evade mobs issue (character stops fighting back.)  Mobs in WOW have begin having single Evade spell misses without being evade bugged, causing issues with Combat Routines that check for Evade bugged mobs.  Singular will now require a minimum number of evade misses on the same NPC before it will be treated as evade bugged.


Hunter

change- All Specs - Misdirection will only be cast as part of Pull Buffs in Instances.  If the BotBase in use does not call the Pull Buffs behavior (Raidbot for example) you will need to cast Misdirection manually if needed or request a change to the BotBase.

fixed - Combat - when Blade Flurry is active will favor using Eviscerate over Rupture as finisher

*new* - All Specs - support for Shadow Blades


Warlock

fixed - Demonology - Doom check for target life expectancy increased from 30 seconds to 45, as on machines with lag we were still casting Doom on characters it would never tick on

fixed - All Specs - Pet summoning logic should be smoother. Will now wait slightly longer after Dismount, will summon more quickly if dies during Combat, and will cancel a summon in progress if live pet appears during Summon Pet cast

General

*new* - Use Instance Behaviors while Solo option on the Debugging tab.  This setting is NOT SAVED since it leads to unexpected results, but allows you to temporarily override the behaviors used for testing combat on a training dummy.

fixed - Restoration - cancel direct heal casts in progress if targets health goes above maximum of Healing Wave, Greater Healing Wave, Healing Surge, and Ignore Mobs Above health % values.

General

fixed - fix a lot of users were looking for!!!!  internal issue causing buffs not to be applied ( Arcane Intelligence, Mark of the Wild, etc. etc. etc.)  There were other behaviors implicated too, but this was the most obvious one.  This was an issue which impacted classes across the board and was due to a change made in a recent prior release.

change- check for Loss of Control behavior in Rest in case initial attack out of combat is a stun, fear, etc

*new* - Questing Pull Distance Override setting added for Ranged specs.  Kick's profiles change the Pull Distance setting it to 25 yards for most combat, which gives less distance for ranged classes to kill a mob before it reaches melee range.  Only during Questing, if the Pull Distance is set to 25 (the default for the setting) it will force it to 40 yards for ranged classes.

This should help tank and group survival when healing at level 25 or lower.  Prior to learning Earth Shield, will favor Tank regardless of group health %


Warlock

fixed - All Specs - Shadowfury now correctly cast on location rather than left on cursor as pending spell


--- Release 3.0.0.1547 ---

General

fixed - Behavior Creation: re-creates Behaviors for Bots that do not reinitialize Combat Routines when entering/leaving instances (historically a BotBase responsibility.)  For example, a Frost DK player using RaidBot to for a raid presses Start button before entering the instance.  This causes Solo behaviors to load (and loads Grinding/Questing behaviors which use Death Grip.)  Since the BotBase did not reinitialize the Combat Routine, the Frost DK would cast Death Grip in a raid.  A Frost DK is used as an example -- this applies to all classes.

change- Pull Buffs: some BotBases (Grinding/Questing for example) are not calling the Pull Buff behavior.  Temporary work around for Singular to call this behavior.  Classes that used this behavior and were impacted included Rogues (all) and Monks (Mistweaver).

fixed - Melee classes moving too close to mobs.  

fixed - Evade bugged mob support.  Should be properly recognized and no longer retarget 

fixed - Missing "Cast ssssss on Nnnnnnnn" log messages.  Duplicate line suppression was added to the HonorBuddy Log window, so if a spell/ability was cast 3 times in a row it would appear to the user it was cast only once.  Singular now works around this making sure every line output is unique

fixed - Targeting in all classes.  Should no longer target or consider mobs that were created by or summoned by another unit (includes totems, bloodworms, etc.)  This will not prevent Bot from targeting these as it deems necessary, but Singular will no longer seek them out

fixed - commented out conflicting version number.  Any extraneous version # reported by HonorBuddy for Singular should be 0.0.0.0

change- display a notice at Start if the Pull Distance is set to less than 25 yards.  Some Questing Profiles set the Pull Distance to extremely low values temporarily.  These short pull distances can cause unexpected results which is often incorrectly attributed to the Combat Routine, so while not an error condition the notice attempts to make you aware.

change- now recognizes LazyRaider and Raid Bot as manual movement bots and will automatically disable Singular movement if Disable Movement set to Auto
