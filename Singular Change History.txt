Druid

Feral

Predatory Swiftness no longer has a chance to make Cyclone instant, free, and castable in all forms.


Restoration

Genesis is a new Restoration spell learned at level 88. Genesis targets all party or raid members within 60 yards and accelerates the casting Druid's Rejuvenation effects, causing them to heal and expire at 400% of the normal rate. Costs the same amount of mana to cast as Rejuvenation.

Talents
Dream of Cenarius: Causes Wrath to deal 20% more damage and heals a nearby friendly target for 100% of the damage done.
Heart of the Wild when activated, now also provides a 25% bonus to healing for Restoration Druids.
Nature's Swiftness is no longer a talent, and is now an ability learned by Balance and Restoration Druids at level 30.
New talent: Ysera's Gift. Ysera's Gift replaces Nature's Swiftness, and heals the Druid for 5% of their maximum health every 5 seconds. If the Druid is at full health, it will heal the most injured friendly target nearby instead.

Glyphs

Glyph of Fae Silence will now cause Faerie Fire to interrupt when used on targets that are immune to silence effects.
Glyph of Efflorescence increases the healing done by Swiftmend by 20%, causes the Efflorescence healing effect to be triggered by Wild Mushroom instead of Swiftmend, and lasts as long as the Wild Mushroom is active.
Glyph of the Moonbeast's effect is now baseline and has been replaced with Glyph of Guided Stars.
Glyph of Guided Stars causes Starfall to only hit targets affected by the Druid's Moonfire or Sunfire.

Monk

Talents

Chi Burst no longer requires a target. It now travels as a 40-yard line in front of the Monk.
Invoke Xuen, the White Tiger now has a pet control bar for Xuen, and the talent is no longer on global cooldown for all Monk specializations. 
Rushing Jade Wind has been redesigned and replaces Spinning Crane Kick.
Rushing Jade Wind: The Monk summons a whirling tornado around them, dealing damage to nearby enemies (heals nearby allies for Mistweavers). Rushing Jade Wind has the same costs, Chi generation, and periodic rate as Spinning Crane kick, but, deals 60% of the periodic damage or healing, lasts 6 seconds, is instant, and not channeled.

Shaman

Restoration

Healing Rain's healing has been reduced by 30%, and the area-of-effect has been increased to 12 yards (up from 10 yards).

Healing Tide Totem is no longer a talent and is a baseline ability for all Shamans. Additionally, this totem will now heal 12 raid members (up from 5) when used in a 25-player instance.

New talent: Totemic Persistence. Summoning a second totem of the same element no longer causes the first totem to be destroyed. Only one non-Fire totem can benefit from this effect at a time.


Warlock

Affliction

Soul Swap no longer does any damage, and now copies damage-over-time effects instead of just moving them without needing a glyph. Copied effects now once again preserve their power and duration. Duration has been reduced to 3 seconds (down from 20 seconds).

Talents

change- Training Dummies: for those prefering to fight things that don't fight back, Singular now automatically switches to Instance spell priorities if targeting a Training Dummy.  Too many people reporting results while using Singular and not in a group (so Solo/Questing spell priority used which is maximized for quick kills and survival, not Raid Boss DPS.)

fixed - Healer Manager: now correctly handles when a group member turns hostile temporary and removes them from the heal list

change- Debug Logging: DebugTrace setting removed from Class Config to prevent use by users misunderstanding its purpose then complaining about amount of debug log output

fixed - Tank Targeting: bug affecting Tank Targeting while using Questing bot with Tank Role fixed (target priority kept switching between tank aggro list and default Questing list.)  Although Questing BotBase does not support group questing, some profile authors have used it to do RAF instance farming.

change- Singular will now output a message when ANY component changes the Pull Distance unless you are in a Raid. Previously this was done only while questing and with debug mode turned on. Since a number of issues have been reported due to running with a Pull Distance of 0 or 1, this will make sure the user is aware of the low value that will prevent the botbase from invoking the Combat Routine for Pulling mobs.

*new* - Solo Pet Tanking.  While solo, classes with a Pet will send that pet to agro targets attacking the player, as long as the pets current target is not the player.  This will increase survivability in multi-mob fights especially at lower levels.  A setting in Class Config named Solo Pet Tanking can be set to false if you prefer the Pet remain on your current target.  This applies to solo (questing/grinding) only.  In PVP and Instances, the Pet will always attack players current target.

fixed - problem with list of Bosses not initiliazing

fixed - Evade mobs issue (character stops fighting back.)  Mobs in WOW have begin having single Evade spell misses without being evade bugged, causing issues with Combat Routines that check for Evade bugged mobs.  Singular will now require a minimum number of evade misses on the same NPC before it will be treated as evade bugged.


Hunter

change- All Specs - Misdirection will only be cast as part of Pull Buffs in Instances.  If the BotBase in use does not call the Pull Buffs behavior (Raidbot for example) you will need to cast Misdirection manually if needed or request a change to the BotBase.

General

fixed - fix a lot of users were looking for!!!!  internal issue causing buffs not to be applied ( Arcane Intelligence, Mark of the Wild, etc. etc. etc.)  There were other behaviors implicated too, but this was the most obvious one.

*new* - Questing Pull Distance Override setting added for Ranged specs.  Kick's profiles change the Pull Distance setting it to 25 yards for most combat, which gives less distance for ranged classes to kill a mob before it reaches melee range.

General

fixed - issue with canceled casts due to move.  this was a biproduct of allowing cast of spell to begin during latency window at end of current spell cast (also referred to as fast casting, allowing for lag, queueing spells, etc.)  this was most noticeable at the start of rest for classes that heal before eating/drinking as well as at times when mounting.

fixed - was inadvertenly cancelling First Aid cast after 6 seconds.  Now correctly waits 8 secondds for Bandages to apply

Warlock

fixed - All Specs - Shadowfury now correctly cast on location rather than left on cursor as pending spell


--- Release 3.0.0.1547 ---

General

fixed - Behavior Creation: re-creates Behaviors for Bots that do not reinitialize Combat Routines when entering/leaving instances (historically a BotBase responsibility.)  For example, a Frost DK player using RaidBot to for a raid presses Start button before entering the instance.  This causes Solo behaviors to load (and loads Grinding/Questing behaviors which use Death Grip.)  Since the BotBase did not reinitialize the Combat Routine, the Frost DK would cast Death Grip in a raid.  A Frost DK is used as an example -- this applies to all classes.

change- Pull Buffs: some BotBases (Grinding/Questing for example) are not calling the Pull Buff behavior.  Temporary work around for Singular to call this behavior.  Classes that used this behavior and were impacted included Rogues (all) and Monks (Mistweaver).

fixed - All Specs - Tremor Totem is now correctly cast when

General

change- Behavior Selection: these were previously using the Normal (solo) behaviors which was causing unexpected use of cooldowns, etc. (including Death Grip.)  Changed to use Instance behaviors.

fixed - Missing "Cast ssssss on Nnnnnnnn" log messages.  Duplicate line suppression was added to the HonorBuddy Log window, so if a spell/ability was cast 3 times in a row it would appear to the user it was cast only once.  Singular now works around this making sure every line output is unique

fixed - Targeting in all classes.  Should no longer target or consider mobs that were created by or summoned by another unit (includes totems, bloodworms, etc.)  This will not prevent Bot from targeting these as it deems necessary, but Singular will no longer seek them out

change- display a notice at Start if the Pull Distance is set to less than 25 yards.  Some Questing Profiles set the Pull Distance to extremely low values temporarily.
