--- Release 3.0.0.1603 ---

General

fixed - issue with canceled casts due to move.  this was a biproduct of allowing cast of spell to begin during latency window at end of current spell cast (also referred to as fast casting, allowing for lag, queueing spells, etc.)  this was most noticeable at the start of rest for classes that heal before eating/drinking as well as at times when mounting.

fixed - cast on location/ground spells were at times leaving spell pending on cursor when target was out of range, dead, etc

fixed - was inadvertenly cancelling First Aid cast after 6 seconds.  Now correctly waits 8 secondds for Bandages to apply

fixed - obscure Ranged class movement issue which was causing Healers and Ranged DPS to sometimes stand in place.  This was most noticeable when questing and character would not chase a fleeing mob and in instances where healer would not move towards a tank requiring healing that was just out of range

change- refactored Cast and Heal composites to single Cast composite.  this will effect any derivate works which use the Heal composite

change- replaced use of optional boolean parameter to indicate allowLagTolerance now uses LagTolerance enum

*new* - Temporary Suspend Movement ability now detects if you are typing into chat window or other frame and ignores temporary movement hotkey presses (which are typically letters)

Druid

*new* - Feral - recognizes shapeshift errors that occur while Questing.  Will leave form and suppress going back in form for 60 seconds.  This allows questing profiles which retry to use quest items or perform actions which fail while in shapeshift form to succeed with no special coding.

fixed - Resto - Instances/Battlegrounds: was only casting Riptide if glyphed or to buff Tidal Waves.  Now will roll on lowest health % group member without buff if no higher priority heal needed.  This should help tank and group survival when healing at level 25 or lower.  Prior to learning Earth Shield, will favor Tank regardless of group health %


Warlock

fixed - All Specs - Shadowfury now correctly cast on location rather than left on cursor as pending spell


--- Release 3.0.0.1547 ---

General

fixed - Behavior Creation: re-creates Behaviors for Bots that do not reinitialize Combat Routines when entering/leaving instances (historically a BotBase responsibility.)  For example, a Frost DK player using RaidBot to for a raid presses Start button before entering the instance.  This causes Solo behaviors to load (and loads Grinding/Questing behaviors which use Death Grip.)  Since the BotBase did not reinitialize the Combat Routine, the Frost DK would cast Death Grip in a raid.  A Frost DK is used as an example -- this applies to all classes.

change- Pull Buffs: some BotBases (Grinding/Questing for example) are not calling the Pull Buff behavior.  Temporary work around for Singular to call this behavior.  Classes that used this behavior and were impacted included Rogues (all) and Monks (Mistweaver).

change- Balance/Feral/Guardian - will now only leave form to cast Healing Touch if Health % is less than Mininum Health % in General settings.  If already in Normal form will continue to heal until topped off

fixed - All Specs - Tremor Totem is now correctly cast when 



--- Release 3.0.0.1496 ---

General

change- Behavior Selection: these were previously using the Normal (solo) behaviors which was causing unexpected use of cooldowns, etc. (including Death Grip.)  Changed to use Instance behaviors.

fixed - Missing "Cast ssssss on Nnnnnnnn" log messages.  Duplicate line suppression was added to the HonorBuddy Log window, so if a spell/ability was cast 3 times in a row it would appear to the user it was cast only once.  Singular now works around this making sure every line output is unique
